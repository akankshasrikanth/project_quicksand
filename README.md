# Quicksand
<p>Quicksand is a vocabulary game, inspired by Hangman.
It is set in a desert where two girls go on an adventure. The player is supposed to guess the blank word in order to save the other girl.
For every incorrect guess, the other girl loses a limb and eventually is left with just her head (symbolising the fact that she is sinking into the quicksand slowly, with each incorrect guess).</p> 
<p>As of now, two scenes have been created for this game. Other features include sounds, soundtrack and basic buttons. 
More scenes and features will be added in the future.</p>
